This is for a Term Assignment.

If you are having trouble running this, make sure that:
   * You have rubygems
   * You have the sqlite3 gem
   * You have permission to open sockets 

Admitedly this was somewhat done in a rush.

To run, open two terminals, in one navigate to server, and run main by

  ruby main.rb 

Go to client, and run mainsimul.rb 

  ruby mainsimul.rb 

That should produce some output. 

Didn't have time to complete the persistence. 
(Didn't have time to complete many things properly actually...)
